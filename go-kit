Go-Kit

This kit is designed for on the go (backpack), it is designed to fit into a backpack for a single individual
I've created a comprehensive individual bug-out bag checklist that prioritizes mobility and self-sufficiency. This bag is designed for one person to carry everything needed to survive independently for 72 hours to indefinitely, depending on the scenario.
Key differences from the home/vehicle kits:
Weight-Conscious Design: Every item is chosen for maximum utility per ounce. The total weight should stay under 20% of your body weight for mobility.
Individual Focus: No need to supply multiple people - allows for more specialized personal equipment and higher-quality individual items.
Mobility Priority: Designed to be grabbed in under 60 seconds and carried for miles if necessary.
Multi-Use Items: Everything serves multiple purposes to maximize efficiency (poncho as shelter, bandana as signaling device, duct tape for repairs, etc.).
Skill-Dependent: Assumes you'll develop the skills to use every item effectively, unlike family kits that might include backup options.
The bag follows the survival priorities: water, shelter, fire, food, security, signaling - in that order. The most critical rule is to practice with this bag regularly at full weight, because a 45-pound pack you can't carry for miles is useless when you need it most.
Would you like me to create a specific packing list for different scenarios (urban evacuation vs. wilderness bug-out) or expand on any particular section?
